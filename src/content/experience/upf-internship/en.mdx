While interning at the University's AI and ML research group, I developed my Bachelor's thesis, ["Parallel Strategies for Best-First Generalized Planning"](/en/projects/parallel-best-first-generalized-planning/). I also had the opportunity to learn from world-renowned researchers in automated planning.

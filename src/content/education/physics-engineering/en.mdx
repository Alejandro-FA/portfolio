After completing my Baccalaureate studies with an honorary distinction, I decided to continue my education with a challenging scientific Bachelor's degree, so I chose Engineering Physics. However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, I discovered my passion for computers and programming, prompting me to switch from Engineering Physics to Computer Engineering. Even though I did not finish my studies, I am deeply appreciative for the learning experience and the brilliant people I met, and for the strong foundation in mathematics and physics that I acquired.

The moment I started my Computer Engineering studies I knew I was in the right place. I graduated in second place, **completing 20 subjects with Honours ("Matr√≠cula de Honor" in Spanish)**, including Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography and Security, Object-Oriented Programming, Machine Learning, and Algorithm Design.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my Bachelor's degree was the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant colleagues. I learned how to work effectively in a team, developing my skills in collaborative planning and organization, technical communication, and software development with version control systems like Git.

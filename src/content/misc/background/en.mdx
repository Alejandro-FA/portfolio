Hi, my name is Alejandro Fern√°ndez Alburquerque, and I have recently graduated from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain) with a degree in Computer Engineering.

From all the Computer Engineering subjects, I especially enjoyed learning about Programming, Algorithm Design, and Artificial Intelligence. The most rewarding highlight of my studies has been working on multiple team projects for different subjects, like developing an automatic face recognition deep learning model or building a reinforcement learning agent for a competitive Pac-Man game. These projects have been an excellent opportunity to acquire teamwork skills and learn how to use modern software collaboration tools. Most of my school projects, including my bachelor thesis, are on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Alejandro-FA) if you are interested in them.

Regarding personal hobbies, I enjoy playing various team sports, such as football and padel, and hiking is one of my favorite summer activities. Additionally, as a good stereotypical computer engineer, I also love playing video games with friends. Furthermore, my interest in technology extends beyond my studies. I like to keep updated with hardware developments and enjoy tinkering with my custom-built desktop PC.
